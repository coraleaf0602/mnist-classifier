# 🧠 MNIST Classifier

Welcome to my MNIST Classifier project! This project is designed to classify handwritten digits from the famous MNIST dataset using a neural network built with PyTorch. 

## 🚀 Features

- **Neural Network**: Built using PyTorch's `nn.Module` with ReLU activation functions.
- **Data Normalization**: Scales pixel values from 0 to 1.
- **Cross-Entropy Loss**: Used for training the model.
- **Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)**: Optimizes the model's parameters.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python**: The core programming language.
- **PyTorch**: Used for building and training the neural network.
- **Torchvision**: For transformations and dataset handling.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
- **Matplotlib**: For plotting graphs and images.
- **Pillow**: For image processing.
